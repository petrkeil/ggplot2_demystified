# Description

This is a tutorial to basic `ggplot2` syntax and functionality. It will be used
during a 1h class for PhD students and postdocs at iDiv.

The main goals are:

- To explain the basic (and unusual) `ggplot2` syntax, and to clarify terms such as 
`geom`, `aes`, `theme`, `stats`, `scale`.

- To give examples of the powerful `ggplot2` functionality, with special 
emphasis on **multivariate data**.

- To show how `ggplot2` handles spatial data.

# Example data
